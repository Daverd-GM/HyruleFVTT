What level is your hazard? Will it be simple or complex? Is it a trap, a haunt, an environmental hazard, or something else? If it’s a trap, is it mechanical, magical, or both? This is a good time to brainstorm the hazard’s name and description, as this will help you decide how the hazard can be disabled. </p><p>The following information builds on concepts from Building Creatures, which starts on page 56.</p><h3>HAZARD TYPES</h3>The three main types of hazards are traps, environmental hazards, and haunts. <p></p><p>Traps are usually built or placed, though they can also form accidentally, such as if a magic portal, through millennia of disuse, malfunctions as its magic warps. Mechanical traps always have some physical component, whereas purely magical traps typically don’t. Magical traps can usually be counteracted by <i>dispel magic</i>, and those without a listed proficiency rank for Stealth can be found using <i>detect magic</i>. Thievery is the most common skill used to disable traps.</p><p>Environmental hazards are either living things, like dangerous spores and molds, or simply features of the terrain or environment, like avalanches or rockslides. While they are always physical, some environmental hazards can’t reasonably be attacked or damaged, such as a cloud of poisonous gas or a patch of quicksand. Survival is the most common skill used to disable environmental hazards.</p><p>Haunts are spiritual hazards, usually formed when the spiritual essence of a location is imprinted with the instincts and emotions from a living being’s demise. Because haunts lack matter, they rarely involve a physical component, and when they do, that component is generally incorporeal or might even be damaged only by positive energy. The skills and options used to disable haunts vary, though using Religion for an exorcism is common. However, even with a successful check to disable a haunt, it can reoccur until its unfinished business is resolved. Typically, successfully disabling or enduring a haunt provides clues to determine what it would take to lay it to rest permanently.</p>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"TJpmyusOtu0C3Mr9","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"UNDERSTANDING AND CHOOSING STATISTICS","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"NzU6MzE1OjMwMw"}},"text":{"content":"<p>Much like for creatures, hazard statistics can be extreme, high, or low (hazards don’t need as much granularity, so they usually don’t have moderate or terrible values for their statistics). While they are defined in creature creation, when building a hazard, you’ll use the values slightly differently.<b>Extreme:</b> While extreme values remain world-class statistics that are extremely difficult to meet or exceed, unlike with monsters, almost all hazards have one extreme statistic because hazards normally activate only if they have gone unnoticed or if someone critically failed to disable them. Does it have an extreme Stealth DC that makes it incredibly hard to find, an extreme Disable DC that makes it perilous to disable, or an extreme save DC that makes it deadly in the event it triggers? These are the most common choices, as each affects a different phase of encountering the hazard.</p><p><b>High:</b> This is a capable level, and can generally serve as a baseline value; this value for hazards covers what would be the high and moderate ranges for creatures.</p><p><b>Low:</b> If a hazard has a weakness, like a poor Reflex save for a bulky mechanical trap or an easy DC to disable for a hard-to-find trap, it usually has a low value. If you need something even lower, use a terrible value from Building Creatures (pages 56–73), or just an incredibly low value like the <i>Armageddon orb</i>’s Stealth (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 526).</p>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"BaE5F4WKk0INNHHd","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"STEALTH AND DISABLE","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"NzY6Njg6NTkx"}},"text":{"content":"<p>When determining a hazard’s combat statistics, first decide how the hazard can be located and how hard it is to disable.

You’ll need to decide the proficiency rank necessary to find the hazard as well as disable it with each method. Remember, a hazard without a listed rank next to its Stealth DC is obvious enough that creatures can find it without Searching, and magical hazards without a listed rank are not normally protected against <i>detect magic</i>. Most hazards built by intelligent creatures are concealed have at least a trained rank. Table 2–14 indicates the high and moderate proficiency requirements by level; you can use lower proficiency ranks than the ones listed, and if you use the high rank, consider a secondary, perhaps less-efficient method to disable the hazard using a lower rank. For instance, the bloodthirsty urge haunt in the <i>Core Rulebook</i> can be disabled with master Religion, or by a higher DC with expert Diplomacy.</p><p>If you need a Stealth modifier for a complex hazard, just subtract 10 from the listed DC.</p><blockquote><h4 data-monster-id=\"NzY6MzA2OjU3OQ\">Table 2-14: Minimum Proficiency</h4><br /><b>Levels High Moderate</b> 0 or lower Untrained Untrained 1–4 Trained (expert for Perception) Trained 5–8 Expert Trained 9–18 Master Expert 19 or higher Legendary Master</blockquote>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"PjhOrZm4pxIOVF7M","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"DEFENSES","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"NzY6MzA2OjQ4Mw"}},"text":{"content":"<p>If there’s a physical component that a character could break, you’ll need to determine the hazard’s AC, Fortitude save, and Reflex save, using the extreme, high, and low values (preceded by E, H, or L on the table) as well as its Hardness, HP, and Broken Threshold (BT).

Often, a simple hazard that merely damages its target is little more than a speed bump that slows down the game without much added value, so think about the purpose of your hazard carefully, both in the story and in the game world, especially when it’s a hazard that a creature intentionally built or placed in that location. A great simple hazard does something interesting, has a longer-lasting consequence, or integrates with the nearby inhabitants or even the encounters in some way (you can find more information on integrating hazards with encounters in Dynamic Encounters on page 48).</p><h3>DESIGNING COMPLEX HAZARDS</h3>Unlike a simple hazard, a complex hazard can play the part of a creature in a battle, or can be an encounter all its own. Many of the concerns with damaging effects when designing a simple hazard don’t apply when designing a complex hazard. A complex hazard can apply its damage over and over again, eventually killing its hapless victim, and isn’t intended to be a quick-to-overcome obstacle.<p></p><p>Complex hazards have a lot more in common with creatures than simple hazards do, and you’ll see that a complex hazard’s statistics are similar to those of a creature. A good complex hazard often requires disabling multiple components or otherwise interacting with the encounter in some way. For instance, while the <i>Core Rulebook’s</i> poisoned dart gallery requires only one Thievery check to disable, the control panel is on the far end of the gallery, so a PC would need to make their way across first.</p><h4>Building Routines</h4><p>A complex hazard has a routine each round, whether it stems from preprogrammed instructions built into a trap, instincts and residual emotions swirling around a complex haunt, or a force of nature like sinking in quicksand. Make sure to build a routine that makes sense for the hazard; an environmental lava chute that ejects lava into the area each round shouldn’t be able to seek out and precisely target only the PCs, but it might spatter random areas within range or everything within range, depending on how you describe the hazard. However, a complex haunt might be able to recognize life force and target living creatures.</p><p>If you create a hazard that can’t consistently attack the PCs (like the <i>Core Rulebook’s</i> blade pillar, which moves in a random direction), you can make it deadlier than normal in other ways.</p><p>The hazard should have as many actions as you feel it needs to perform its routine. If you split the routine out into several actions, you can also remove some of the hazard’s actions once partial progress is made in disabling or destroying it; this can give the PCs a feeling of progress, and it can encourage them to handle the hazard if it appears in a encounter alongside creatures. </p>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"LkZ68wMp7MZEm56u","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"SIMPLE HAZARDS","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"Nzg6Njg6NzEx"}},"text":{"content":"<p>A simple hazard uses its reaction when triggered.</p><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzg6Njg6Njc1\">Shrieker - Hazard -1</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzg6Njg6NDcx\">Snowfall - Hazard 0</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzg6Njg6MjQz\">Hampering Web - Hazard 1</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzg6MzA2OjY2Mw\">Brown Mold - Hazard 2</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzg6MzA2OjQ1OQ\">Treacherous Scree - Hazard 3</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzk6Nzc6NjI3\">Titanic Flytrap - Hazard 4</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzk6Nzc6MjQz\">Spectral Reflection - Hazard 5</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzk6MzE1OjUwNw\">Ghostly Choir - Hazard 6</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzk6MzE1OjIzMQ\">Green Slime - Hazard 9</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODA6Njg6NDgz\">Jealous Abjurer - Hazard 11</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODA6Njg6MjMx\">Plummeting Doom - Hazard 15</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODA6MzA2OjU1NQ\">Grasp Of The Damned - Hazard 17</h4>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"IeifY6eJpeLUBFd5","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"COMPLEX HAZARDS","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"ODE6Nzc6NDk1"}},"text":{"content":"<p>Complex hazards roll initiative and act on their turn.</p><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODE6Nzc6NDU5\">Eternal Flame - Hazard 7</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODE6MzE1OjcxMQ\">Confounding Betrayal - Hazard 8</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODE6MzE1OjI3OQ\">Perilous Flash Flood - Hazard 10</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODI6Njg6Mjkx\">Flensing Blades - Hazard 12</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODI6MzA2OjU3OQ\">Dance Of Death - Hazard 16</h4>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"lISccmte5C1PshK1","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tVqslRjv9OohJc2c":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677697961025,"modifiedTime":1677697961025,"lastModifiedBy":"tVqslRjv9OohJc2c"},"_id":"0U9kO4xgL05AvYF1"}

This deals <b>persistent damage</b>,a special type of damage that doesn’t happen right away. Instead, that hero takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of their turn (not the rat’s turn). The hero can then attempt a flat check (roll a d20 without adding anything) to see if the fire goes out—if the result is a 15 or higher, the flames are extinguished! If not, they’ll take the damage again at the end of their next turn (rolling 1d4 each time they take this damage), and then roll a new flat check. This happens at the end of every turn until the fire goes out.<p></p><p>There are other actions a hero can use to put out the fire. A hero can spend an action to pat out the flames. If they do, they can roll a flat check right away, before they take the damage, as described above. A hero might also think to go jump in the puddle of water. If they drop to the ground in a square filled with water (gaining the prone condition), the flames go out automatically.</p><h3>ELEMENTAL, CINDER RAT</h3><p></p><blockquote><p><b>Perception</b> +9; darkvision, smoke vision<b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +10, Stealth +10, Survival +9<b>Smoke Vision</b> The cinder rat ignores the concealed condition </p><p>from smoke.<b>AC</b> 18; <b>Fort</b> +9, <b>Ref</b> +12, <b>Will</b> +6<b>HP</b> 45; <b>Immunities</b> bleed, fire, poison, sleep; <b>Weaknesses</b> cold 5<b>Fetid Fumes</b> A cloud of smoke surrounds a cinder rat.

Both are intact and appear to be relatively stable. If anyone casts <i>detect magic</i> in this chamber, they sense the presence of magic. </p><p>The air orb is filled with a swirling cloud. If anyone touches it, a rush of wind fills the room, carrying a voice like a whisper. It says, “Call upon the wind to gain my blessing and soar through the sky.” This gives the heroes a special ability they can each use once within the next 24 hours. By spending 1 action to call upon the wind, that hero can fly for their next action, moving up to 40 feet. They have to end the movement on solid ground—if they don’t, they fall and take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance they fell.</p><p>If the heroes touch the earth orb, they hear grinding and grumbling, like boulders falling down a hill. In this cacophony, they hear another voice that says, “Call upon the earth to gain its strength.” The heroes gain a second ability they can each use once within the next 24 hours. If a hero spends an action to call upon the earth, all their melee Strikes deal 2 extra damage from a sudden surge of strength. This bonus lasts until the start of the hero’s next turn.</p><p>The orb’s magical effects happen only once. If the players come back here again, the orbs are silent and don’t offer any benefits.</p><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>If the heroes encounter and defeat the cinder rat, award each hero 80 XP.</p></blockquote>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"f4M2mYGoWb6vBdyW","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"15.

If they do, they find a small bag tied to the waist of one of the foul creatures. Inside the leather pouch is a handful of strange coins, minted in some faraway kingdom deep underground—the coins show a tower inside a cave on one side and a sinister-looking elf’s head on the other. These coins amount to 38 sp and 4 gp.</p><h3>Passage into Darkness</h3>Two passages lead out of this room, other than the way the heroes came in. One leads off the map, heading steadily down, deep into the earth. This tunnel leads into the Darklands, a vast subterranean realm deep underground filled with all sorts of deadly creatures and sinister monsters. This is where the xulgaths came from, but it’s beyond the scope of this adventure. <p></p><p>If the heroes travel down this way, tell them that after an hour of travel, they see no sign of the creatures that broke into the fishery and should probably turn back before getting hopelessly lost. The Darklands are for more experienced adventurers, and the players should explore the surface more before delving into these lightless realms.</p><p>The other passageway exiting this room looks like it was dug recently. This tunnel curves up and around before ending in a thin wall of loose stones and dirt. A tiny hole in the wall allows creatures to look into the room beyond (<b>Area 17</b>). If a hero peeks through the wall, they can see the kobolds in that area going about their daily routines. If they spend time listening to the kobolds’ chatter, the heroes overhear a few phrases, including “when we stole the egg” and “more fish for the pet.” A hero who wants to break open this wall can attempt a DC 20 Athletics check. On a success, they break down the wall! On a failure, the wall remains intact, and the kobolds in <b>Area 17</b> notice the sound and prepare for a fight.</p>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"bfrBqgvaQXJs2LqX","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"EXPERIENCE POINTS","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"MjI6MzUyOjUzMQ"}},"text":{"content":"<blockquote><p>If the heroes defeat the xulgaths in this room, award each hero 120 XP.</p></blockquote>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"27WO1KPxCLsSrdNY","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"16.

When the heroes enter this area, read the following aloud.</p><blockquote><p>While much of this rectangular chamber is in ruins, the center contains a fountain of pristine water with something glittering at the bottom. In the middle of the fountain is a marble statue of a mermaid, her lips pursed as if she were about to blow a kiss, or maybe whistle. Each corner of the pool has some sort of mechanism embedded in the stones, but the one in the southwest corner appears to be smashed.</p></blockquote><h3>FOUNTAIN TRAP</h3><p>The mermaid statue in the center of the room is the center of a devious trap. When the heroes enter the room, ask each player to roll a Perception check—roll a d20 and add their Perception. Write down these results, because you’ll also use them to determine the heroes’ initiative. </p><p>If anyone’s total is 20 or higher, they notice the trap before setting it off. If not, the heroes don’t notice anything unusual. They can act normally—but if anyone steps on any of the tiles adjacent to the pool, the trap goes off!</p><p>This trap is complex, which means it works like a monster. If the heroes trigger the trap, use the Perception results you wrote down before to determine their initiative. The fountain rolls Stealth for its initiative. </p><p>On its turn, the statue in the middle of the fountain spins around, shooting a stream of high-pressure water from its mouth. The exact effects are different each round and target random parts of the room. The trap’s Routine entry describes how this works.</p><h3>Overcoming the Trap</h3>The heroes can overcome this trap in a variety of ways. If someone notices it before it goes off and everyone avoids the squares adjacent to the fountain, they can safely bypass the trap. <p></p><p>Once the trap goes off, the heroes can try to disable the control mechanisms located at each corner of the pool. If any of these stones are still active, the trap continues to act on its turn, but fortunately for the heroes, the mechanism in the southwest corner has already been destroyed (leaving only those in the other three corners to deactivate). To deactivate a mechanism, a hero must stand in an adjacent square and spend 2 actions to attempt a DC 20 Thievery skill check. On a success, that mechanism is disabled.</p><p>The heroes can also physically destroy the three remaining mechanisms by attacking them individually (using the AC and Hit Points in the trap’s stat block). The fountain, being made of stone, has <b>Hardness</b>. Each time a hero hits a mechanism, subtract this number from the damage roll before reducing the mechanism’s Hit Points.</p><p>Once there are no functioning mechanisms left, whether the heroes have disabled or destroyed them, the trap stops working, and the heroes can continue their exploration.</p><h3>MERMAID FOUNTAIN</h3><p></p><blockquote><p><b>Notice</b> DC 20 Perception check<b>Initiative</b> Stealth +10<b>Disable</b> DC 20 Thievery on each corner mechanism (must disable </p><p>all three working corners to disable the trap)<b>AC</b> 18; <b>Fort</b> +7, <b>Ref</b> +5<b>Corner Mechanism Hardness</b> 8; <b>Corner Mechanism HP</b> 15<b>Routine</b> Each turn, the fountain uses 1 action.

Roll a d4 and count to the number you rolled, starting with the player on your left, to determine which hero gets attacked. The spray is a ranged Strike with +10 to hit. On a hit, it deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage (doubled on a critical hit as normal).</p><p><b>5–7 Corner Spray</b> The statue spins about, firing a spray of water at each corner of the room that still has a functioning corner mechanism. This hits any creature adjacent to the corner mechanism, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Each hero must attempt a DC 15 basic Reflex save, taking no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, full damage on a failure, and double damage on a critical failure.</p><p><b>8–9 Half Room</b> The statue spins about, spraying half of the room with water. Roll any die. If the result is even, it sprays the west half; otherwise, it sprays the east half. This deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature in that half of the room, and each hero must attempt a DC 15 basic Reflex save.</p><p><b>10 Full Room</b> This works just like the half-room attack, but it targets everyone in the room.</p></blockquote><h3>LOOTING THE FOUNTAIN</h3> <p>Once the trap is deactivated, a hero can easily climb into the fountain and get the coins. The water is only 1 foot deep, and while it’s very cold, it’s not dangerous. Inside the fountain are 28 cp, 8 sp, and 2 gp. </p><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>If they heroes bypass the fountain, disable it, or destroy it, award each hero 80 XP.</p></blockquote>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"4oSciEwEd6vPIxfs","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"17. Kobold Warren","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"MjQ6MTAxOjcxOQ"}},"text":{"content":"<p>This chamber houses the majority of the kobold band dwelling here. Get six kobold warrior pawns from the box. When the heroes enter the room, read the following aloud.</p><blockquote><p>As the door opens, the smell of rotten fish and mold wafts out. On the west side of this vast room is a large table with benches on either side. Old food scraps, dirty knives, and broken plates cover the table. Off to the east side, burrows have been dug into the wall to make small sleeping chambers filled with straw mats. This must be the kobolds’ warren!</p></blockquote><h3>KOBOLD FIGHT</h3><p>The kobolds beneath Otari have claimed this chamber as their home. Six of them are here, but their exact location depends on the heroes’ actions in other areas. If the heroes made lots of noise breaking through the wall between this area and the xulgath den (<b>Area 15</b>) or by destroying the mechanisms for the mermaid fountain trap (<b>Area 16</b>), place all six of the kobolds in the center of the room, ready to attack, as shown on the map by the kobolds with gray outlines. If the heroes were quiet, the kobolds are relaxing when the heroes enter. Place three of them at the table, and put the other three in the sleeping alcoves, as shown on the map by the kobolds with orange outlines. </p><p>Wherever the kobolds are, they’re not happy about having visitors. They spring to attack! Ask each player to roll initiative, and roll Perception once to determine when the kobolds get their turn. </p><p>Though the kobolds all take their turns at the same time, they don’t focus on any one character. Pairs of kobolds might try to flank one hero to use their sneak attack, while others use the unconventional tactics described below. </p><p>While fighting the heroes, the kobolds boast of their mighty lineage and combined power, assuring the “soft-skin” heroes that they’ll surely come to regret trespassing into the kobolds’ domain. However, they remain just as cowardly as the kobolds the heroes have already defeated in these caverns.</p><p>Unlike all the foes the heroes have faced so far, the last remaining kobold tries to surrender. </p><h3>Unconventional Tactics</h3>These kobolds use tactics in their fight, such as attempting to flank the heroes whenever possible. Since this is their home, they have a few other tricks they can use against the heroes. Use these throughout the fight to add variety and keep the players on their toes!<b>Bed Cover:</b> A kobold in one of the sleeping chambers can spend 1 action to pull a sleeping mat off the floor and hide behind it. Doing <p></p><p>so grants the kobold a +1 circumstance bonus to its AC until they move or the start of their next turn.</p><p><b>Food Fight:</b> A kobold adjacent to the table can spend 1 action to pick up a scrap of rotting meat and throw it at a hero within 20 feet. This is a ranged Strike with a +5 to hit. If the Strike hits, it doesn’t deal damage. Instead, the hero takes a –1 status penalty to d20 rolls and DCs until they spend an action to clean the gross food off. </p><p><b>Oil Attack:</b> The chest between two of the sleeping alcoves contains, among other things, three jars of slippery oil. A kobold must spend an action to open the chest before they can use the oil stored inside. Once the chest is open, a kobold next to it can spend 1 action to pick up and throw one of these jars of oil. This is a ranged Strike with a +5 to hit. If it hits a hero, that hero and the square they’re in are coated in slippery oil. On a miss, the oil covers the ground but not the hero. The kobold can also throw the oil at an empty square to make just the square slippery.</p><p>For the rest of the fight, a hero covered in oil has trouble moving. Each time they Stride, they must attempt a DC 10 Acrobatics skill check. If they fail, they fall over and gain the prone condition instead of moving. The hero can Step, moving only 5 feet, without this check. </p><p>Anyone who moves through a square covered in oil must attempt a DC 10 Acrobatics skill check. If they fail, they stop moving and fall. </p><h3>KOBOLD WARRIORS (6)</h3><p></p><blockquote><p><b>Perception</b> +3; darkvision<b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +5, Crafting +2, Stealth +5<b>Items</b> leather armor, spear (3)<b>AC</b> 16; <b>Fort</b> +4, <b>Ref</b> +7, <b>Will</b> +3<b>HP</b> 8 <b>Stride</b> [one-action]25 feet<b>Melee Strike</b> [one-action] spear +3, <b>Damage</b> 1d6+1 piercing <b>Ranged Strike</b> [one-action] spear +5 (thrown 20 feet), <b>Damage</b> </p><p>1d6+1 piercing<b>Hurried Retreat</b>[one-action] If the kobold is adjacent to at least one enemy, </p><p>the kobold Strides up to 30 feet and gains a +2 circumstance </p><p>bonus to ACagainst reactions triggered by this movement. </p><p>They must end this movement in a space that’s not adjacent </p><p>to any enemy.<b>Sneak Attack</b> The kobold warrior deals an extra 1d4 damage to </p><p>creatures that have the flat-footed condition.</p></blockquote><h3>KOBOLD SURRENDER</h3><p>When only one kobold remains, he immediately drops his weapons and surrenders to the heroes, begging and groveling for his life with a raspy, high-pitched voice. If the heroes spare the kobold, the creature promises to leave and never return, but he also quietly adds that he’s willing to share secrets in exchange for gold. </p><p>The heroes have two options if they want to learn what the kobold knows. The first is to offer the kobold the gold he requests. If they give the kobold 10 gp, he shares what he knows about the boss, and if they give him 20 gp (total, not in addition), he also shares what he knows about the dragon. </p><p>But parting with their hard-earned wealth isn’t the only solution. A hero can try to persuade the kobold to share what he knows by rolling a Diplomacy skill check, or they can bully the kobold with an Intimidation skill check. If a hero’s total is 10 or more, they learn about the boss, and if their total is 20 or more, they learn about the dragon, too. </p><p><b>About the Boss:</b> The kobold says the following about their warren’s boss. “Boss Zolgran is the big leader of the mighty kobolds, and she has powerful magics to roast you alive! She’s very angry all the time and demands much from her servants. Especially now that we have a powerful new friend!”</p><p><b>About the Dragon:</b> The kobold says the following about the dragon. “The friend is a dragon and a blessing from the gods, a sign that kobolds are destined to return to the surface and conquer the pathetic human town. As soon as the hatchling is all grown, we’ll rise up to take what is ours!” </p><h3>KOBOLD LOOT</h3>Once the fight ends, the heroes can examine the rest of the warren. Each kobold here is wearing a copper-and-eggshell necklace like those found in <b>Area 12</b>. In addition to the kobolds’ gear, there’s a chest filled with trinkets and collected valuables. It holds a bolt of fine silk cloth worth 5 gp, a painting of an adventurer on a horse worth 2 gp, a sack filled with 20 sp, a crystal decanter filled with old, sour wine (the decanter is worth 1 gp), 3 jars of oil (minus any the kobolds threw during the fight), a <i>ladder feather token</i> (page 53), and a <i>healing potion</i> (page 52).<p></p><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>For overcoming the kobolds in this room, award each hero 120 XP. Note that the heroes can earn additional XP depending on how they handle the last remaining kobold.</p></blockquote><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>If the heroes defeat Zolgran and her guards, award each hero 100 XP. If the heroes are still level 1 when they defeat this encounter, they each gain a bonus of 40 XP due to the additional challenge.</p></blockquote><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>If the heroes get the surrendered kobold to tell them </p><p>about the boss, award each hero an additional 10 XP. If they </p><p>get him to tell them about the dragon, increase this bonus </p><p>to 30 XP instead.</p></blockquote><hr /><h4>LEVEL UP!</h4><blockquote><p>If the heroes overcame all of the challenges through <b>Area 17</b></p><p>they should have enough XP to gain a level! Going up to 2nd </p><p>level gives each hero the boost of power they’ll need to face the </p><p>final two encounters against the kobold boss and the dragon! </p><p>You might also encourage the party to rest at this point.You can help the players level up their heroes by telling </p><p>them the following information.</p><p>• Each hero increases their maximum Hit Points based on their class (6 for the wizard, 8 for the cleric and rogue, and 10 for the fighter). Everyone also gets to add their Constitution to their maximum Hit Points. </p><p>• For any statistic where a hero is trained or an expert, increase that statistic by 1. This includes AC, all three saving throws, Perception, many skills, spell DCs (for spellcasters), and attack rolls. Don’t increase ability modifiers, damage rolls, or attacks and skills that the hero isn’t trained or expert in. </p><p>• Each character gains new abilities from their class! Clerics and wizards also gain an additional 1st-level spell slot, allowing them to cast one more spell each day.All of these details are summarized on the pregenerated </p><p>character sheets, and further details can be found in the </p><p><i>Hero’s Handbook</i>. </p></blockquote>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"EW9cSPPox9Gx54zo","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"18.

Place the boss on the throne, and put the two scouts at the bottom of the stairs. When the heroes enter the room, read the following aloud.</p><blockquote><p>A gaping pit opens in the floor in the center of this large, natural chamber. On the far side, a ledge overlooks the entry. Atop this ledge is an ornate stone throne that looks entirely out of place for this room. A regal kobold wearing an oversized crown made of fish bones sits atop the throne. “Kill the intruders!” she snarls at the two kobold guards at the foot of the stairs.</p></blockquote><p>Things have been rough for the band over the past few years, but their fortune changed when they got the chance to steal a dragon’s egg! With the precious treasure spirited away to the kobold hideout, the boss, Zolgran, has devised grand plans for her band now that it has a dragon patron. After raising the dragon, she hopes to use the beast to subjugate the entire region and finally reclaim the town of Otari for her people. Fortunately for the citizens of Otari, the baby dragon isn’t fully grown yet—but the new hatchling is always hungry. That’s why the band moved into these caverns, and why they’ve been raiding the Otari Fishery. Without a steady supply of food, the young dragon might turn to having kobolds for a snack! </p><h3>THE PIT</h3>This pit in the center of this chamber is 20 feet deep. Heroes attempting to leap across the pit must spend 2 actions and attempt a DC 15 Athletics skill check. If they fail, they fall down into the pit, taking 10 damage. A hero in the pit has to climb out, which requires them to succeed at two DC 10 Athletics skill checks in a row. <h3>FIGHTING THE BOSS</h3>The dragon isn’t yet tame enough to do the boss’s bidding, so the kobolds have kept the creature in a nearby mushroom cave, safely tucked away from rest of the band. Unfortunately for the heroes, the boss and her guards are more than dangerous enough on their own.The two kobold scouts move to either side of the pit to block the heroes from getting to their boss, but they chase any hero who manages to get past them. Meanwhile, Zolgran assaults the groups using spells! The crafty kobold can cast spells just like a wizard. The spells she has prepared are listed in her stat block. A complete description of what these spells do can be found on page 36 of the <i>Hero’s Handbook</i>. On her first turn, she spends all 3 actions to cast <i>magic missile</i>. This spell fires three missiles, which she aims at the closest three heroes to deal 1d4+1 force damage each. If anyone gets past her guards, she casts <i>fear</i> on that hero, hoping to make them run away. If she runs out of 1st-level spells to cast, she casts <i>ray of frost</i>. Zolgran attacks with her staff only if she runs out of other options.<h3>KOBOLD SCOUTS (2)</h3><p></p><blockquote><p><b>Perception</b> +8; darkvision<b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +7, Crafting +3, Nature +6, Stealth +7, Survival +6<b>Items</b> crossbow (20 bolts), eggshell necklace, leather armor, </p><p>shortsword<b>AC</b> 18; <b>Fort</b> +5, <b>Ref</b> +9, <b>Will</b> +6<b>HP</b> 16 <b>Stride</b> [one-action]25 feet<b>Melee Strike</b> [one-action] shortsword +9 (agile, finesse, versatile S), </p><p><b>Damage</b> 1d6 piercing<b>Ranged Strike</b> [one-action] crossbow +9 (range increment 120 feet, </p><p>reload 1), <b>Damage</b> 1d8 piercing<b>Hurried Retreat</b>[one-action] If the kobold is adjacent to at least one enemy, </p><p>the kobold Strides up to 30 feet and gains a +2 circumstance </p><p>bonus to ACagainst reactions triggered by this movement. </p><p>They must end this movement in a space that’s not adjacent </p><p>to any enemy.<b>Sneak Attack</b> The kobold scout deals an extra 1d6 damage to </p><p>creatures that have the flat-footed condition.</p></blockquote><blockquote><h4 data-monster-id=\"Mjc6NTQ6NDEx\">Zolgran, Kobold Boss</h4><br /><b>Perception</b> +5; darkvision<br /><b>Skills</b> Arcana +6, Deception +8, Diplomacy +8, Dragon Lore +10, Intimidation +8, Stealth +7<br /><b>Str</b> –1, <b>Dex</b> +3, <b>Con</b> +0, <b>Int</b> +2, <b>Wis</b> +1, <b>Cha</b> +4<br /><b>Items</b> eggshell necklace, iron key, staff<br /><b>AC</b> 17; <b>Fort</b> +4, <b>Ref</b> +7, <b>Will</b> +7<br /><b>HP</b> 25; <b>Resistances</b> poison 5<br /><b>Stride</b> [one-action]25 feet<br /><b>Melee Strike</b> [one-action]claw +7 (agile, finesse), <b>Damage</b> 1d6–1 slashing<br /><b>Melee Strike</b> [one-action]staff +3, <b>Damage</b> 1d8–1 bludgeoning<br /><b>Spells</b> Zolgran can cast these wizard spells (spell DC 20, spell attack +12). <b>1st Level</b><i>fear</i>, <i>magicmissile</i> (×3); <b>Cantrips</b> <i>detectmagic</i>, <i>ghostsound</i>, <i>magehand</i>, <i>ray of frost</i><br /><b>Sneak Attack</b> Zolgran deals an extra 1d6 damage to creatures that have the flat-footed condition.</blockquote><h3>ZOLGRAN’S TREASURE</h3><p>The ledge the throne sits on also serves as Zolgran’s personal resting area. A straw pallet rests here, like those in <b>Area 17</b>. Heroes who examine the out-of-place throne can match its design to the decor of <b>Area 11</b> on the floor above, which is where the kobolds took it from. Most importantly, there’s an old, rusty iron chest. Atop this chest is a large, broken eggshell that’s almost 2 feet tall. Ivory in color, the shell has green veins running through it, and it’s clear that the pieces of eggshell worn by the boss and many of the kobolds here came from this egg. Although it’s still not entirely clear what was inside, there are large claw marks, bigger than any kobold could make, down one side of the shell.</p><p>The chest is locked, but Zolgran has the key tied at her waist. If the heroes don’t find the key, a character with a set of thieves’ tools can attempt a DC 25 Thievery skill check, and the lock opens on a success! Inside the chest are some of the more interesting treasure that the kobolds found during their exploration of these tunnels. The treasure includes a silver bracelet with a fish pattern worth 5 gp, a very old map that depicts some strange-looking dungeon, a <i>smoking sword</i> with a dwarven face carved into the hilt (page 51), a <i>wand of heal</i> (page 53), 2 <i>healing potions</i> (page 52), and a <i>hat of disguise</i> (page 55).</p><h3>ARE WE DONE?</h3>If the PCs defeat the kobolds and their boss, they might return to the Otari Fishery. If they decide not to explore any further, the adventure can easily end here. Tamily happily pays the heroes for completing the job, even if she does wonder what was in that mighty egg. She’s also curious as to what happened to all the fish, as the kobolds couldn’t possibly have eaten it all, but such mysteries will have to wait for another day. In this case—or if the heroes don’t end up fleeing from the next encounter—the young dragon in the kobolds’ care survives! Eventually the dragon leaves the cave and starts hunting in the countryside, becoming a menace for years to come. Fortunately, dragons grow in power very slowly. The heroes might find themselves chasing down this beast in the future! If they’ve gained a few more levels, they’ll have an edge in the fight.More likely, though, the players might push on to explore the next cavern—<b>Area 19</b>. That encounter is the most dangerous fight of the entire adventure, so feel free to encourage the heroes to rest if they’re out of limited resources, such as spells.<p></p><hr /><h4>A HARD FIGHT</h4><blockquote><p>This might be a very tough fight for the heroes, especially if they haven’t reached level 2 yet. If they’re forced to retreat, Zolgran doesn’t follow them, but she orders her guards to do so. If the heroes slay these guards but still retreat, Zolgran recruits two kobold warriors to serve as her new guards for the next time the heroes arrive. See <b>Area 17</b> for kobold warrior statistics. They aren’t as powerful as kobold scouts, but they still help defend their boss. </p></blockquote>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"A0r8s8zwEAdED4F2","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"19.

The dragon uses many abilities in the fight against the heroes and is fiercely territorial of the cave. However, the kobolds have trained the hatchling to stay in this area, so the heroes can retreat if they need to recover.<h3>Breath Weapon</h3>The dragon can spend 2 actions to breathe out a cloud of deadly gas that deals 5d6 poison damage to everyone in a 30-foot cone starting from the dragon’s space. Anyone caught in this breath must roll a <b>basic Reflex save</b> against a DC of 24. As with all basic saves, a creature takes no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, full damage on a failure, and double damage on a critical failure. You’ll roll damage only once and determine how much damage everyone takes based on their saving throw.<p></p><p>This attack could spell doom for the party, but the wyrmling doesn’t have much experience using their breath weapon effectively. The dragon doesn’t try to catch all the heroes with this attack, but focuses on just the nearest opponent. Once the dragon uses the breath weapon ability, they can’t use it again for 1d4 rounds or until they get a critical hit on a Strike. </p><h3>Special Attacks</h3>The dragon’s favorite tactic (and most reliable attack) is to Stride forward and then use Draconic Frenzy, an ability that allows the beast to spend 2 actions to make two claw Strikes and a tail Strike in any order. The second and third Strikes during the Draconic Frenzy take the multiple attack penalty:  –5 on the second attack (or –4 if the second attack uses a claw Strike), and –10 on the third attack (or –8 if using a claw).<p></p><p>The dragon also has a special Twisting Tail reaction. When someone within 10 feet tries to move, the dragon can spend their reaction for that round to make a tail Strike (but with only +10 on the roll instead of the usual +12) against that foe. If the dragon hits, the target stops moving and loses the rest of that action (though the target can use another action to move again if they want).</p><h3>DRAGON, WYRMLING GREEN</h3><p></p><blockquote><p><b>Perception</b> +11; darkvision<b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +8, Arcana +11, Athletics +12, Deception +9, </p><p>Diplomacy +11, Intimidation +11, Nature +9, Occultism +12, </p><p>Society +9, Stealth +10<b>AC</b> 22; <b>Fort</b> +11, <b>Ref</b> +11, <b>Will</b> +12<b>HP</b> 60; <b>Immunities</b> sleep <b>Twisting Tail</b>[reaction] When a creature within 10 feet uses a move </p><p>action or leaves a square during a move action it’s using, the </p><p>dragon can use their reaction to make a tail Strike at the </p><p>creature with a –2 penalty.

The heroes can catch a glimpse of this treasure even from the floor, but anyone who wants to climb up to the ledge must succeed at a DC 15 Athletics skill check. Atop the ledge sits a small chest and a huge pile of coins. There are 429 cp, 63 sp, and 18 gp in this vast pile. There’s also a single giant emerald atop the heap that vaguely looks like the dragon’s eye, which can be sold for 20 gp.</p><h3>TUNNEL TO THE SURFACE</h3>The back of the mushroom grotto has a tunnel leading to a long, winding passageway. If the heroes explore this way, they find that it gently slopes upward, and they can feel a fresh breeze coming from this direction. After following this path for over an hour, they emerge from a small cave in a ravine outside the town of Otari. Remnants of a camp around the cave’s entrance indicate that the kobolds had stayed here for some time before heading under the town to work their mischief. <p></p><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>Once the heroes manage to defeat the dragon, award each hero 120 XP.</p></blockquote>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"iNNbst8QAf1Yj6j2","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"WRAPPING UP","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"Mjk6MzMzOjIxOQ"}},"text":{"content":"<p>With a lot of courage and a bit of luck, the adventurers hopefully survived their encounter with the kobolds and their “pet,” returning to the town as triumphant heroes!

What level is your hazard? Will it be simple or complex? Is it a trap, a haunt, an environmental hazard, or something else? If it’s a trap, is it mechanical, magical, or both? This is a good time to brainstorm the hazard’s name and description, as this will help you decide how the hazard can be disabled. </p><p>The following information builds on concepts from Building Creatures, which starts on page 56.</p><h3>HAZARD TYPES</h3>The three main types of hazards are traps, environmental hazards, and haunts. <p></p><p>Traps are usually built or placed, though they can also form accidentally, such as if a magic portal, through millennia of disuse, malfunctions as its magic warps. Mechanical traps always have some physical component, whereas purely magical traps typically don’t. Magical traps can usually be counteracted by <i>dispel magic</i>, and those without a listed proficiency rank for Stealth can be found using <i>detect magic</i>. Thievery is the most common skill used to disable traps.</p><p>Environmental hazards are either living things, like dangerous spores and molds, or simply features of the terrain or environment, like avalanches or rockslides. While they are always physical, some environmental hazards can’t reasonably be attacked or damaged, such as a cloud of poisonous gas or a patch of quicksand. Survival is the most common skill used to disable environmental hazards.</p><p>Haunts are spiritual hazards, usually formed when the spiritual essence of a location is imprinted with the instincts and emotions from a living being’s demise. Because haunts lack matter, they rarely involve a physical component, and when they do, that component is generally incorporeal or might even be damaged only by positive energy. The skills and options used to disable haunts vary, though using Religion for an exorcism is common. However, even with a successful check to disable a haunt, it can reoccur until its unfinished business is resolved. Typically, successfully disabling or enduring a haunt provides clues to determine what it would take to lay it to rest permanently.</p>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"bvuMv2W97v7bKipm","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"UNDERSTANDING AND CHOOSING STATISTICS","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"NzU6MzE1OjMwMw"}},"text":{"content":"<p>Much like for creatures, hazard statistics can be extreme, high, or low (hazards don’t need as much granularity, so they usually don’t have moderate or terrible values for their statistics).

Does it have an extreme Stealth DC that makes it incredibly hard to find, an extreme Disable DC that makes it perilous to disable, or an extreme save DC that makes it deadly in the event it triggers? These are the most common choices, as each affects a different phase of encountering the hazard.</p><p><b>High:</b> This is a capable level, and can generally serve as a baseline value; this value for hazards covers what would be the high and moderate ranges for creatures.</p><p><b>Low:</b> If a hazard has a weakness, like a poor Reflex save for a bulky mechanical trap or an easy DC to disable for a hard-to-find trap, it usually has a low value.

Often, a simple hazard that merely damages its target is little more than a speed bump that slows down the game without much added value, so think about the purpose of your hazard carefully, both in the story and in the game world, especially when it’s a hazard that a creature intentionally built or placed in that location. A great simple hazard does something interesting, has a longer-lasting consequence, or integrates with the nearby inhabitants or even the encounters in some way (you can find more information on integrating hazards with encounters in Dynamic Encounters on page 48).</p><h3>DESIGNING COMPLEX HAZARDS</h3>Unlike a simple hazard, a complex hazard can play the part of a creature in a battle, or can be an encounter all its own. Many of the concerns with damaging effects when designing a simple hazard don’t apply when designing a complex hazard. A complex hazard can apply its damage over and over again, eventually killing its hapless victim, and isn’t intended to be a quick-to-overcome obstacle.<p></p><p>Complex hazards have a lot more in common with creatures than simple hazards do, and you’ll see that a complex hazard’s statistics are similar to those of a creature. A good complex hazard often requires disabling multiple components or otherwise interacting with the encounter in some way. For instance, while the <i>Core Rulebook’s</i> poisoned dart gallery requires only one Thievery check to disable, the control panel is on the far end of the gallery, so a PC would need to make their way across first.</p><h4>Building Routines</h4><p>A complex hazard has a routine each round, whether it stems from preprogrammed instructions built into a trap, instincts and residual emotions swirling around a complex haunt, or a force of nature like sinking in quicksand. Make sure to build a routine that makes sense for the hazard; an environmental lava chute that ejects lava into the area each round shouldn’t be able to seek out and precisely target only the PCs, but it might spatter random areas within range or everything within range, depending on how you describe the hazard. However, a complex haunt might be able to recognize life force and target living creatures.</p><p>If you create a hazard that can’t consistently attack the PCs (like the <i>Core Rulebook’s</i> blade pillar, which moves in a random direction), you can make it deadlier than normal in other ways.</p><p>The hazard should have as many actions as you feel it needs to perform its routine. If you split the routine out into several actions, you can also remove some of the hazard’s actions once partial progress is made in disabling or destroying it; this can give the PCs a feeling of progress, and it can encourage them to handle the hazard if it appears in a encounter alongside creatures. </p>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"zfX0E7LKXMbnN7Aj","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"SIMPLE HAZARDS","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"Nzg6Njg6NzEx"}},"text":{"content":"<p>A simple hazard uses its reaction when triggered.</p><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzg6Njg6Njc1\">Shrieker - Hazard -1</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzg6Njg6NDcx\">Snowfall - Hazard 0</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzg6Njg6MjQz\">Hampering Web - Hazard 1</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzg6MzA2OjY2Mw\">Brown Mold - Hazard 2</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzg6MzA2OjQ1OQ\">Treacherous Scree - Hazard 3</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzk6Nzc6NjI3\">Titanic Flytrap - Hazard 4</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzk6Nzc6MjQz\">Spectral Reflection - Hazard 5</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzk6MzE1OjUwNw\">Ghostly Choir - Hazard 6</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"Nzk6MzE1OjIzMQ\">Green Slime - Hazard 9</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODA6Njg6NDgz\">Jealous Abjurer - Hazard 11</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODA6Njg6MjMx\">Plummeting Doom - Hazard 15</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODA6MzA2OjU1NQ\">Grasp Of The Damned - Hazard 17</h4>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"r6cdbrJftwhFokGv","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"COMPLEX HAZARDS","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"ODE6Nzc6NDk1"}},"text":{"content":"<p>Complex hazards roll initiative and act on their turn.</p><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODE6Nzc6NDU5\">Eternal Flame - Hazard 7</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODE6MzE1OjcxMQ\">Confounding Betrayal - Hazard 8</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODE6MzE1OjI3OQ\">Perilous Flash Flood - Hazard 10</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODI6Njg6Mjkx\">Flensing Blades - Hazard 12</h4><h4 data-monster-id=\"ODI6MzA2OjU3OQ\">Dance Of Death - Hazard 16</h4>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"cHVFJxfb0n7YWPKL","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tVqslRjv9OohJc2c":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677698261212,"modifiedTime":1677698261212,"lastModifiedBy":"tVqslRjv9OohJc2c"},"_id":"V5x2r7t7YbWtHLK8"}

Before starting, get the giant rat pawns from the box. You’ll need one giant rat for each player. When you’re ready, read the following to the players.</p><blockquote><p>The stairs leading into the basement of the Otari Fishery creak with age as you make your way downstairs to find the beast that has been eating all the fish. In the center of the room, between stone pillars holding up the fishery overhead, are barrels filled with salted fish. Two of these barrels have been smashed open, spilling their contents on the floor. In the east wall is a large hole, opening into darkness.</p><p>Just a few hours ago, you gathered with a few other adventurers in the office of Tamily Tanderveil’s office, where she offered you ten gold pieces each if you could put an end to this menace. She was thrilled when you agreed to help her with this simple task, but as you make your way downstairs, you can’t help but wonder if this might be a lot more adventure than you bargained for.</p></blockquote><p>Go around the table and ask each player the first thing they want their hero to do in the room. As each player describes their action, allow them to move their pawn around this area, but don’t let them leave the room just yet. </p><p>The shelves along the walls on the north and south sides of the room are piled high with general supplies that belong to the fishery. Heroes who investigate the hole in the wall on the east side of the room find piles of loose rock and dirt on the inside of the room. It looks like something has broken open the wall from the other side! </p><p>After each player has had a chance to do one thing, an ominous skittering noise comes from the hole in the wall—giant rats emerge to attack! Read the following to the players.</p><blockquote><p>A strange chittering comes from the hole in the wall. Suddenly, a massive rat the size of a dog emerges from the darkness—and it isn’t alone! The giant rats rush toward you, their huge teeth snapping.</p></blockquote><h3>THE FIRST COMBAT</h3><p>The heroes are now in combat with four giant rats. Place the pawns for the rats on the map as shown on the map above, near the hole in the east wall. In combat, each player takes turns and follows specific rules about what they can and can’t do. See the next page for step-by-step instructions on how to handle combat.</p><p>The giant rats’ statistics are below. Only the statistics relevant to this combat are included, but you can find the rest on page 75 if you need them.</p><p>Roll a d20 and add the giant rats’ Perception to find their initiative. The rats all take their turns at the same time, but each one acts independently. On its turn, each rat moves toward a different hero and attacks. If a hero falls unconscious, the rat moves to the next nearest and attacks. </p><h3>Attacks</h3>When a creature uses the Strike action to make an attack, first pick a target. A creature must be in a space next to its target (including diagonally) to use a melee Strike, such as the rats’ jaws Strike. Roll a d20 and add the statistic for that attack. For the giant rats’ Strike, you’ll add 7 to the number that comes up on the die. Then compare the total against the Armor Class (AC) of the hero being attacked. If the rat’s total is equal to or higher than the hero’s AC, the rat hits! It deals the amount of damage listed in the Damage section of that Strike. In this case, roll 1d6 and add 1 to determine the damage it deals—the hero loses that many Hit Points.<p></p><p>If you roll a 20 on the die, or the total is at least 10 more than the hero’s Armor Class, it’s a critical hit! These deal twice as much damage: roll 1d6 and add 1, then double the number to determine the damage.</p><h3>RATS, GIANT (4)</h3><p></p><blockquote><p><b>Perception</b> +5; low-light vision<b>AC</b> 15; <b>Fort</b> +6, <b>Ref</b> +7, <b>Will</b> +3<b>HP</b> 8<b>Stride</b> [one-action]30 feet<b>Melee Strike</b>[one-action] jaws +7 (agile), <b>Damage</b> 1d6+1 piercing</p></blockquote><h3>AFTER COMBAT</h3><p>Once one side is defeated or flees, you don’t need to track actions anymore and heroes no longer need to act in order. Instead, go around the table and ask the players what the heroes would like to do next. If the heroes return to talk to Tamily, she’s relieved to learn that the rats are dead, but she is certain that rats couldn’t have caused all of the destruction below. The heroes will have to explore further if they want to earn their reward. When the players decide to explore beyond this room, turn to <b>Area 2</b> on page 6.</p><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>For defeating the giant rats, give each hero 80 XP.</p></blockquote>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"n9DeSstppuy8z4Eu","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"2. Drop into Darkness","flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"ODoxMDE6NzE4"}},"text":{"content":"<p>After dealing with the rats, the heroes are free to explore the hole in the east wall of the storeroom. It is big enough for a human to crawl through with ease. Once the first hero enters the area beyond, read the following aloud.</p><blockquote><p>Squeezing through the hole, you find yourself in a cavern that seems to stretch endlessly beneath the streets of Otari. Who knows what menace could be lurking down here? Up ahead, the passageway ends in a cliff that plunges sharply into the darkness.</p></blockquote><p>The monsters that broke into the storeroom used this passageway to break through the wall, but they came from much deeper parts of the vast series of caverns beneath Otari.</p><h3>SKILL CHECKS</h3>To continue on their adventure, the players must find a way to climb down a short, slippery cliff. Instead of using combat abilities, the heroes each need to attempt a skill check to see if they succeed or fail. This check requires the <b>Athletics</b> skill, which is used for climbing up and down walls, ropes, and trees. When a character attempts a skill check, they roll a d20 and add the relevant skill. Compare the total to the Difficulty Class (or DC) of the task to determine whether or not they succeed. As with attack rolls, characters can get critical successes and critical failures on skill checks (page 5).<p></p><p>The cliff is only 10 feet tall, but the surface is slick with moisture. The DC of the Athletics check to climb safely is 15. Whenever a character tries to climb up or down this cliff, refer to the table at the bottom of this page to determine the results.</p><h3>Rope and Other Forms of Aid</h3>The players might decide to use rope to help them scale the cliff. They can easily tie a rope to one of numerous sturdy stalagmites nearby. Once this is done, the Athletics check to climb up or down is only DC 10; a character critically fails only by rolling a 1 on the die, and they score a critical success if the total is 20 or higher. <p></p><p>The heroes might also try and help each other get up and down. A character helping someone else climb must attempt their own Athletics check to assist. If they succeed, the character climbing gets a +1 circumstance bonus to their check (+2 if the assisting character critically succeeds). A hero providing assistance must still roll their own Athletics check to climb up or down themself.</p><blockquote><p><b>Critical Success</b> (The die roll was a 20 or the total was 25 or more.) The character climbs up or down the cliff, reaching their destination safely.<b>Success</b> (The result of the check was 15 or more.) The character climbs 5 feet up or down the wall. They must roll another check to complete the journey.<b>Failure</b> (The result of the check is less than 15.) The character makes no progress at all. They stay where they are at on the wall. <b>Critical Failure</b> (The die roll was a 1 or the total was 5 or less.) The character falls to the ground. If they were at the top, they take 5 damage from the fall. If they were halfway up, they take only 2 damage from the fall. If the character was trying to climb up and this was their first check, they simply fall prone and take no damage.</p></blockquote><h3>EXPLORING THE DUNGEON</h3><p>Once the heroes climb down the cliff, they can continue onward to the next area. There is little of interest in this tunnel, but anyone who looks can find a trail in the dust and grime, making it clear that creatures have come this way in the recent past. Moisture and time have obscured any details such as footprints, however. The mushrooms in the lower part of the chamber are particularly bitter, but edible. </p><p>From this point onward, the characters are free to explore the dungeon at their own pace. They can continue to press forward, or they can retreat back to the town above to rest and get new supplies. </p><p>Once the heroes have explored an area, that area remains as the heroes left it the last time they were there. Any monsters left alive recover lost Hit Points, but those that were killed remain dead upon the heroes’ return.</p><h3>Light</h3>From this area onward, the chambers are completely dark unless their descriptions state otherwise. Characters who have darkvision from their ancestry or heritage can see normally. Others need to provide their own source of light so that they can see. As long as one character is holding a torch, most of the rooms are small enough that the torch illuminates the entire area. More precise rules for light can be found on page 63 of the <i>Hero’s Handbook</i>, should you need them.<p></p><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>Once the heroes have all climbed down the cliff, award them each 10 XP for overcoming this challenge.</p></blockquote>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"P3bBwLdAYMgw2Vr5","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}},{"name":"3.

You can just barely make out vast strands of webbing across the floor and walls of this cavern, stretching between stalactites like shimmering curtains. </p></blockquote><p>This fight uses the same rules as the first fight against the rats, but it also incorporates skill checks when dealing with webs and includes a new kind of roll—a saving throw—to resist the spider’s poisonous bite!</p><p>This chamber is home to a very big spider, waiting to ambush anything that wanders through its web. The webs aren’t sticky enough to make anyone who touches them unable to move, but they do slow characters down.

Moving into a square of difficult terrain costs an extra 5 feet of movement, and a creature can’t Step into a square of difficult terrain. The spider isn’t affected by its webs and can move normally throughout the chamber.</p><p>When the players enter the chamber, the spider is in its lair in the northeast corner of the room. It does not emerge to attack until someone touches one of its webs. Anyone trying to cross through the room without touching the webs must attempt an <b>Acrobatics</b> skill check to carefully balance on rocks and narrow ledges. The Difficulty Class of this check is 15. If anyone fails the check, the spider senses them in the room and emerges to attack.</p><h3>SPIDER FIGHT</h3>The fight with the spider plays out very much like the combat with the rats. As soon as someone touches one of the webs or fails an Acrobatics check to balance while crossing the room, call for everyone to roll for initiative—usually using Perception, or Stealth for anyone who was hiding at the time. The spider rolls Perception for its initiative (its stat block appears on page 8).<p></p><p>After you have everyone’s initiative results, start the first round of combat with the character who rolled the highest initiative result. Each character gets to use 3 actions when their turn comes up, and when everyone has had a turn, start over again at the beginning. </p><p>The heroes might avoid this fight by carefully moving around the webs. They might also flee from the spider. The spider refuses to leave this area, retreating to its webbed den in the northeast if all the heroes flee. </p><h3>Saving Throws</h3>Whenever the spider manages to successfully attack a character with its fangs, it injects poison as part of the attack. Whenever a character is subjected to poison, they must attempt a special check called a <b>saving throw</b> to resist its effects. There are three types of saving throw: a Fortitude save is typically for resisting poison or disease, a Reflex save is for dodging away from falling debris or avoiding a deadly beam from a spell, and a Will save is usually for resisting spells and magic that befuddle the mind.<p></p><p>Anyone who is bitten by the spider must immediately attempt a Fortitude saving throw by rolling a d20 and adding their Fortitude. If the result is equal to or greater than 16, they resist the poison and suffer no ill effect. If the result is less than 16, the poison takes hold! A poisoned character takes 1d12 additional damage and gains a <b>condition</b>, a special effect that adjusts their statistics as long as it remains. In this case, they gain the flat-footed condition for 1 round—this means they are slow to react to threats, so they take a –2 status penalty to their Armor Class. </p><h3>Ranged Strikes</h3>The giant spider in this room also has a special ranged Strike that lets it throw webbing to trap a nearby creature. Unlike for a melee Strike, the giant spider doesn’t have to be adjacent to a hero to target them with a ranged Strike—it can target a hero anywhere in the room. Otherwise, a ranged Strike works just like a melee Strike. Choose a target, roll a d20 and add 7 for the giant spider’s web Strike, and then compare the total to the Armor Class of the target hero to see if it hits. <p></p><p>While ranged Strikes normally deal damage just like melee Strikes, this web Strike is special. If the attack roll is a success, the target doesn’t take any damage. Instead, the target can’t move out of their square until they successfully use the Escape basic action. The target can attempt a check to Escape using the Acrobatics skill or Athletics skill, or a fists attack roll, and the DC is 17. Each attempt to Escape is a single action. </p><p>If the total result of the check to Escape is 17 or greater, the target breaks free from the webs and can move freely. A stuck hero can still attack, cast spells, and otherwise act normally, but they can’t move from their current space on the map.</p><h3>SPIDER, GIANT</h3><p></p><blockquote><p><b>Perception</b> +7; darkvision<b>AC</b> 17; <b>Fort</b> +6, <b>Ref</b> +9, <b>Will</b> +5<b>HP</b> 16 <b>Stride</b> [one-action]25 feet <b>Melee Strike</b> [one-action] fangs +9, <b>Damage</b> 1d6+2 piercing plus giant </p><p>spider venom<b>Ranged Strike</b> [one-action] web +7 (range increment 30 feet), <b>Effect</b> web </p><p>trap<b>Giant Spider Venom</b> (poison) A target damaged by the spider’s </p><p>fangs must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d12 </p><p>poison damage and gain the flat-footed condition for 1 round.<b>Web Trap</b> A creature hit by the giant spider’s web Strike gets </p><p>stuck to the nearest surface.

Ask anyone who explores the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check. If they succeed, they spot a wrapped up bundle of bones and dried skin that looks like it was some sort of small, reptilian creature (in fact, it’s a kobold, one of the creatures responsible for breaking into the basement of the fishery). The bundle also contains a few items of value. The first is a shortsword that has a small emerald in the pommel. While the sword isn’t magical, the fine craftsmanship and precious gem make it worth 5 gp if sold. There is also a <i>healing potion</i> that restores 1d8 Hit Points instantly when consumed (see page 52 for details).</p><h3>AVOIDING THE THREAT</h3>If the heroes are very careful moving around this room, they might avoid the fight with the spider entirely. They might also flee from the spider, moving past the encounter in this area without defeating it. In either case, the spider remains a threat every time the heroes pass through this chamber.<p></p><p>In some adventures, the situation changes if the players take too long or rest too often, but this adventure and its encounter remain the same no matter how long the players take in exploring this dungeon. Any creatures the heroes defeat remain dead or destroyed, and any creatures they avoid remain in the same place—potentially posing a danger if the heroes pass through that area again later!</p><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>Sometimes challenges offer multiple ways for the heroes to overcome them. No matter how the heroes overcome a challenge, they earn XP for doing so—but only the first time they overcome it!

Alcoves line the walls, each one containing a rotten wooden coffin, while the center of the room has a raised platform holding a stone sarcophagus.</p></blockquote><h3>UNDEAD FIGHT</h3><p>This crypt holds foul undead creatures that rise to attack any living thing foolish enough to disturb their slumber. If the players made a lot of noise breaking through the barricade in <b>Area 4</b>, the skeletons and zombie have already broken free from their coffins and are standing, ready for a fight. But if the heroes were quiet when they took apart the barricade, the undead are still in their coffins, and combat begins when they push aside their lids as soon as the heroes enter.

This means they probably take their turns at different times during the round. The skeletons and zombie both roll Perception for initiative.</p><h3>Undead Abilities</h3>These undead have special rules that affect how they take damage. Both types of undead have <b>immunities</b> that prevent certain types of damage and abilities from affecting them. They aren’t affected by anything with the mental trait, they don’t take poison damage, and they can’t fall unconscious—even from effects with the nonlethal trait. <p></p><p>Skeletons have <b>resistances</b> that reduce the amount of damage they take from certain damage types. Each time a skeleton takes damage of a type listed in its Resistances entry, reduce the amount of damage it takes by the number after the type. For example, if a hero hits a skeleton with a longsword Strike and would deal 8 slashing damage, the skeleton would take only 3 damage. </p><p>Zombies have <b>weaknesses</b>, which work in the opposite way. Whenever the zombie takes any damage of the listed types, increase the damage it takes by the number listed after it. The zombie would take 13 damage from same hero’s longsword Strike that originally dealt 8 damage, because of the zombie’s weakness to slashing damage!</p><p>Zombies have one more special ability called slow that represents their ponderous, staggering movements.

Two stone statues of priests stand in the corners along one side of the room, facing a towering statue of a man holding out both of his hands, palms up. In front of this statue is a stone altar holding nine golden coins. A voice booms out from the statue.</p><p>“In my hands I judge the value of all wealth, raising up whichever is greater.

On a success, they know the statue depicts Abadar, the god of wealth and civilization. </p><h3>THE PUZZLE</h3>The statue and the coins represent a puzzle. The challenge here is to identify which of the coins is fake. All of them look identical and they all weigh exactly the same, but the fake coin is worth less than the others. Explain to the players that when the heroes place coins in the statue’s hands, it will raise the hand that has a higher value. So if the heroes put four coins in each hand and the right hand contains the fake, the statue will raise the left hand. After two attempts, the statue asks the heroes to identify the fake. <p></p><p>If they fail to identify the fake coin, all the coins vanish and reappear in a random order atop the altar. If the coins are taken from the altar and not placed in the hands, they also vanish and the puzzle resets. Any real coins added to the puzzle vanish immediately, added to the vault in <b>Area 10</b></p><p>. The heroes can try again as many times as they’d like. Failing to solve this puzzle doesn’t prevent the heroes from completing the adventure, but it does make the next combat a bit more challenging because of the trap in <b>Area 11</b>.</p><p>If they succeed, the real coins fall to the floor and the heroes can take them as treasure (each is worth 1 gp), while the fake coin turns to lead. In addition, the door to <b>Area 10</b>slowly swings open, which gives the heroes access to Abadar’s treasure and allows them to adjust the traps in <b>Area 11</b> to work in their favor. </p><p>When running this puzzle for the players, tell the players they must decide how they want to weigh coins numbered 1 through 9, and secretly pick which number represents the fake coin. If they fail to identify the fake coin and decide to try again, pick a new number (since the puzzle resets). The players might accidentally pick the fake coin without solving the puzzle, and that’s okay—adventurers get lucky sometimes! To make this puzzle simpler, you might want to provide props, like pieces of paper with a coin drawn on each one, numbered 1 through 9. </p><h3>The Solution</h3>The trick to solving the puzzle is to split the coins into three groups of three coins each. By placing one group of three in each hand and leaving the third group on the altar, the players can determine which group contains the fake coin. If one hand rises, the other hand contains the fake. If neither rises, then the fake is in the three coins that were left on the altar. The heroes then need to repeat this process with the group containing the fake, by placing one coin in each hand and leaving the third on the altar. If one hand rises, the coin in the other hand is the fake. If neither rises, the coin on the altar is the fake.<p></p><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>Not all challenges are dangerous!

See Central Spears above for more information.</p><p>The kobold trapmaster stays where she is, spending all of her actions to lay down small spike traps. If she puts down all three of her spike traps, she then uses her spears to attack the heroes from afar until they approach.</p><h3>KOBOLD WARRIORS (3)</h3><p></p><blockquote><p><b>Perception</b> +3; darkvision<b>Items</b> dried fish, leather armor, spears (3)<b>AC</b> 16; <b>Fort</b> +4, <b>Ref</b> +7, <b>Will</b> +3<b>HP</b> 8 <b>Stride</b> [one-action]25 feet<b>Melee Strike</b> [one-action]spear +3, <b>Damage</b> 1d6+1 piercing <b>Ranged Strike</b> [one-action]spear +5 (thrown 20 feet), <b>Damage</b> 1d6+1 piercing<b>Hurried Retreat</b>[one-action]If the kobold is adjacent to at least one </p><p>enemy, the kobold Strides up to 30 feet and gains a +2 </p><p>circumstance bonus to ACagainst reactions triggered by this </p><p>movement.

The kobolds’ gear is listed in their stat blocks.</p><p>The kobold trapmaster is wearing a special necklace: a simple copper chain and a cracked piece of a large eggshell. The shell is ivory in color, but it has strange green veins running through it. This piece is only about 3 inches across, but the egg it came from must have been at least 2 feet wide. Even if the heroes take this piece back to town, no one can identify what sort of creature would lay such a massive egg, although Tamily speculates that it might have come from a giant turtle or another reptile. The heroes have the chance to learn more about this strange egg later in the dungeon. </p><h3>GOING DOWN?</h3>After defeating the kobolds, the heroes can take their belongings (noted in each creature’s stat block). The heroes won’t find other treasure in the room, but there’s another exit: the spiral staircase in the back of the room descends even deeper into the earth.<p></p><p>This is a great time for the heroes to rest and regain their spells and Hit Points before pressing onward. You should remind them of this option and encourage them to head back up to Otari to report what they discovered. They can also use this time to sell any treasure they’ve found and purchase additional gear. </p><p>If the heroes report to Tamily Tanderveil about the scaly creatures creeping around the caverns, she’s shaken by the story of what they found underneath her fishery, and she implores the heroes to press on to put an end to this menace. She can identify the creatures as kobolds, small reptilian humanoids related to dragons who live in small tribes and have a fondness for traps. She also notes the amount of fish that has gone missing is far greater than what could have been eaten by a handful of kobolds. Tamily is worried that there’s something far hungrier beneath the city, and she shares her concern with the heroes.</p><p>If the players have had a particularly hard time with the adventure thus far, you can also use this opportunity to give them a bit of help. Tamily has a pair of <i>potions of healing</i> stored away in case of emergency. A hero who drinks one of these potions immediately regains 1d8 Hit Points. Tamily gladly gives both potions to the heroes if they agree to continue their exploration.The challenges in the second level of the dungeon are more dangerous than those in the first level. In their explorations of this level, the players will learn the truth behind the missing fish. A band of kobolds under the city has recently hatched a green dragon wyrmling, and have been raiding the Otari Fishery to provide a steady diet for their growing charge. If the heroes don’t defeat this menace, the dragon might grow up to spell doom for the town of Otari!</p><p>The players will have to use all their skills and abilities if they hope to defeat the kobolds—and the dragon. As with the first level, unless noted otherwise, the chambers in this level aren’t lit. The kobolds all have darkvision and have little need for light.</p><p>Flip over the map so the second level is face-up, and have the players each place their pawns on the staircase leading down. </p><hr /><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><blockquote><p>For overcoming the kobolds and the hazards in this room, give each hero 136 XP.</p></blockquote>","format":1},"src":null,"type":"text","_id":"NhhBOhhkfl25XFgc","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tVqslRjv9OohJc2c":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677698964166,"modifiedTime":1677698964166,"lastModifiedBy":"tVqslRjv9OohJc2c"},"_id":"cMJXTQp4RT7mZ6KF"}
