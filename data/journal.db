Luckily the Legend of Zelda already provides a target choice of musical pieces for you to use! Do not force yourself to use those however, a smooth narration Will always be the most important tool in a GM's arsenal.</p><p>Depending on your players choices the story from there can head toward a large variety of places. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the town before running the adventure so you can change things as needed.</p><p>You Will also want to read the parts outside ahead of time, in particular the beach, as it's the key to this adventure. </p><p>Notes that a few events only take place at the start of the second day of the PCs' stay. Depending on how fast your PCs are you might want to adapt the time of the day such things take place. Don't forget that running around town and talking to people takes time and it's already mid-day when the PCs arrive so night should fall around the time they explored most of Horon. If your PC decides to rest the first day you can move every second day event to the third instead.</p><p>Horon is a typical rural town. The beach nearby isn't suited to setup a proper fishing business so its main source of income are the pumpkins produced at Jenkin's farm. Mutoh's carpenter business is the second main employer around here and a strong rivalry has blossomed between the two owners.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":0,"cBKvJi6BDRNRZTAN":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"reclaim-the-wild","systemVersion":"2.09","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1679241380780,"modifiedTime":1685305300568,"lastModifiedBy":"cBKvJi6BDRNRZTAN"},"_id":"Y3j3IJaZurMH3yYN"}
